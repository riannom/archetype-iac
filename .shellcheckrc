# Project-wide shellcheck configuration

# SC1091: Not following sourced file (e.g., /etc/os-release unavailable in CI)
# SC2086: Double quote to prevent globbing — pervasive in install scripts,
#         variables contain known-safe values (paths, branch names, URLs)
# SC2034: Variable appears unused — false positive for loop counters (for i in ...)
# SC2155: Declare and assign separately — common export pattern in install scripts
# SC2162: read without -r — intentional for interactive user input prompts
