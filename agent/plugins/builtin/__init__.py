"""Built-in vendor plugins.

This package contains vendor plugins that ship with Archetype.
These plugins provide support for common network device types.

To add a new built-in plugin:
1. Create a new module (e.g., myvendor.py)
2. Define a class that extends VendorPlugin
3. The loader will automatically discover and load it
