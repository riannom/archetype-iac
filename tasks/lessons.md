## 2026-02-14: sed `a` command does NOT interpret `\t` as tab in single quotes

**Bug**: `sed -i '/pattern/a\\ttext' file` produces literal `\t` instead of a tab character.

**Impact**: LVM `global_filter` was written as `\tglobal_filter = ...` (invalid config key). LVM silently ignored it, leaving the system vulnerable to the NBD/LVM crash cascade. This caused repeated system hangs on agent-01 requiring power cycles.

**Fix**: Use `$'...'` ANSI-C quoting: `sed -i $'/pattern/a\\\\\ttext' file` to get a real tab.

**Rule**: Always verify config changes take effect. For LVM, run `lvm dumpconfig <setting>` after writing to `lvm.conf`. Never trust `grep` alone to validate config correctness.
